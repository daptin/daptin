An action can have a set of required input fields or none at all. Actions can also be built to handle callbacks/webhooks from other services (like payment gateway server to server notification). Actions can be thought of as follows: A set of inputs (key value pair, extracted from query params and request body) A set of outcomes based on the inputs What are actions and why do I need this Link Create/Read/Update/Delete (CRUD) APIs are only basic APIs exposed on the database, and you would rarely want to make those API available to your end user. Reasons could be multiple The end user doesn't (immediately) owe the data they create Creating a \"row\"/\"data entry\" entry doesn't signify completion of a process or a flow Usually a \"set of entities\" is to be created and not just a single entity (when you create a user, you also want to create a usergroup also and associate the user to usergroup) You could allow user to update only some fields of an entity and not all fields (eg user can change their name, but not email) Changes based on some entity (when you are going through a project, a new item should automatically belong to that project) Actions provide a powerful abstraction over the CRUD and to handle a variety of use cases. Actions can also make use of operations imported from OpenAPI Specs of other services. To quickly understand what actions are, lets see what happened when you \"signed up\" on Daptin. Take a look at how \"Sign up\" action is defined. We will go through each part of this definition An action is performed on an entity. Let's also remember that world is an entity itself. Action schema Link Name : signup Label : Sign up InstanceOptional : true OnType : user_account InFields : - Name : name ColumnType : label IsNullable : false - Name : email ColumnType : email IsNullable : false - Name : password ColumnType : password IsNullable : false - Name : Password Confirm ColumnName : passwordConfirm ColumnType : password IsNullable : false Validations : - ColumnName : email Tags : email - ColumnName : name Tags : required - ColumnName : password Tags : eqfield=InnerStructField[passwordConfirm],min=8 Conformations : - ColumnName : email Tags : email - ColumnName : name Tags : trim OutFields : - Type : user_account Method : POST Reference : user Attributes : name : \"~name\" email : \"~email\" password : \"~password\" confirmed : '0' - Type : usergroup Method : POST Reference : usergroup Attributes : name : \"!'Home group for ' + user.name\" - Type : user_user_id_has_usergroup_usergroup_id Method : POST Reference : user_usergroup Attributes : user_id : \"$user.reference_id\" usergroup_id : \"$usergroup.reference_id\" - Type : client.notify Method : ACTIONRESPONSE Attributes : type : success title : Success message : Signup Successful - Type : client.redirect Method : ACTIONRESPONSE Attributes : location : \"/auth/signin\" window : self Action Name Link Name: \"signup\", Name of the action, this should be unique for each actions. Actions are identified by this name Action Label Link Label: \"Sign up\", Label is for humans OnType Link OnType: \"user_account\", The primary type of entity on which the action happens. This is used to know where the actions should come up on the UI Action instance Link InstanceOptional: true, If the action requires an \"instance\" of that type on which the action is defined (more about this below). So \"Sign up\" is defined on \"user\" table, but an instance of \"user\" is not required to initiate the action. This is why the \"Sign up\" doesnt ask you to select a user (which wouldn't make sense either) Input fields Link InFields: []api2go.ColumnInfo This is a set of inputs which the user need to fill in to initiate that action. As we see here in case of \"Sign up\", we ask for four inputs Name Email Password Confirm password Note that the ColumnInfo structure is the same one we used to define tables . Validations Link Validations : [] ColumnTag Validations validate the user input and rejects if some validation fails { \"ColumnName\" : \"email\" , \"Tags\" : \"email\" } This tells that the \"email\" input should actually be an email. One of the more interesting validations is cross field check { ColumnName : \"password\" , Tags : \"eqfield=InnerStructField[passwordConfirm],min=8\" , } , This tells that the value entered by user in the password field should be equal to the value in passwordConfirm field. And the minimum length should be 8 characters. Conformations Link Conformations: []ColumnTag Conformations help to clean the data before the action is carried out. The frequently one used are trim and email . Trim: trim removes white spaces, which are sometimes accidently introduced when entering data Email: email conformation will normalize the email. Things like lowercase + trim OutFields Link OutFields: []Outcome OutFields are the list of outcomes which the action will result in. The outcomes are evaluated in a top to bottom manner, and the result of one outcome is accessible when evaluating the next outcome. We have defined three outcomes in our \"Sign Up\" action. Create a user { Type : \"user_account\" , Method : \"POST\" , Reference : \"user\" , Attributes : map [ string ] interface {}{ \"name\" : \"~name\" , \"email\" : \"~email\" , \"password\" : \"~password\" , \"confirmed\" : \"0\" , } , } , This tells us that, the first outcome is of type \"user\". The outcome is a \"New User\" (POST). It could alternatively have been a Update/Find/Delete operation. The attributes maps the input fields to the fields of our new user. ~name will be the value entered by user in the name field ~email will be the entered in the email field, and so on If we skip the ~ , like \"confirmed\": \"0\" Then the literal value is used. Reference: \"user\", We have this to allow the \"outcome\" to be referenced when evaluating the next outcome. Let us see the other outcomes JavaScript in fields - \"!...\" Link { Type : \"usergroup\" , Method : \"POST\" , Reference : \"usergroup\" , Attributes : map [ string ] interface {}{ \"name\" : \"!'Home group for ' + user.name\" , } , } , Daptin includes the otto js engine .

Tables have columns. Each column has a particular data type. Tables are exposed as JSON APIs under the /api/<entityName> path. Automatic creation Link Import CSV or XLS file and you can let Daptin create the entities for you based on intelligent data pre-processor. Manual creation Link YAML/JSON schema Link If you are looking for a more reproducible way, design your entities and create JSON or YAML files. These files can be used again to create an exact same replica. Multiple schema json files can be uploaded, and changes are merged accordingly. Lets imagine we were creating a todo application and wanted to keep a track of the following for each todo item Todo list example the todo text field - title YAML example Tables : - TableName : todo Columns : - Name : title DataType : varchar(500) ColumnType : label IsIndexed : true JSON example { \"Tables\" : [ { \"TableName\" : \"todo\" , \"Columns\" : [ { \"Name\" : \"title\" , \"DataType\" : \"varchar(500)\" , \"ColumnType\" : \"label\" , \"IsIndexed\" : true } ] } ] } Data validations Link Along with the fields mentioned above, we might want certain validations and conformations whenever we store a new todo Validations title cannot be empty order has to be numeric Once we have come up with the above picture in mind, we can use one of the following ways to tell daptin about this. Daptin uses the excellent go-playground/validator library to provide extensive validations when creating and updating data. It gives us the following unique features: Cross Field and Cross Struct validations by using validation tags or custom validators. Slice, Array and Map diving, which allows any or all levels of a multidimensional field to be validated. Validation Example Link JSON example Link JSON files are the primary way to create new entities in daptin. The above two ways ultimately create a JSON file or fetch from the market. The JSON for our todo entity will look as follows: { \"Tables\" : [{ \"TableName\" : \"todo\" , \"Columns\" : [{ \"Name\" : \"title\" , \"DataType\" : \"varchar(500)\" , \"ColumnType\" : \"label\" , \"IsIndexed\" : true }, { \"Name\" : \"completed\" , \"DataType\" : \"int(1)\" , \"ColumnType\" : \"truefalse\" , \"DefaultValue\" : \"false\" }, { \"Name\" : \"deadline\" , \"DataType\" : \"date\" , \"ColumnType\" : \"date\" , \"IsNullable\" : true }, { \"Name\" : \"order\" , \"ColumnName\" : \"item_order\" , \"DataType\" : \"int(4)\" , \"ColumnType\" : \"measurement\" , \"DefaultValue\" : \"10\" }, { \"Name\" : \"text\" , \"DataType\" : \"text\" , \"ColumnType\" : \"content\" , \"IsNullable\" : true } ], \"Conformations\" : [{ \"ColumnName\" : \"order\" , \"Tags\" : \"numeric\" }], \"validations\" : [{ \"ColumnName\" : \"title\" , \"Tags\" : \"required\" }] ] } Name: Name is a human readable name Column Name: Name of the column in the table Column Type: The type of the column. Daptin supports a variety of types and these allow daptin to give you useful options in future (eg for viewing a timeline, a date/datetime column is required) Default value: Columns can have default values, which is used a new row is created and no value for that column is specified. YAML example Link YAML example for todo entity is as follows Tables : - TableName : todo Columns : - Name : title DataType : varchar(500) ColumnType : label IsIndexed : true - Name : url DataType : varchar(200) ColumnType : url IsNullable : true - Name : completed DataType : int(1) ColumnType : truefalse DefaultValue : 'false' - Name : schedule DataType : date ColumnType : date IsNullable : true - Name : order ColumnName : item_order DataType : int(4) ColumnType : measurement DefaultValue : '10' - Name : text DataType : text ColumnType : content IsNullable : true Conformations : - ColumnName : order Tags : numeric Validations : - ColumnName : title Tags : required You can choose to work with either json or yaml. Once the schema is ready, it can be uploaded directly from daptin dashboard. Online entity designer Link The entity designer is accessible from dashboard using the \"Online designer\" button. Here you can set the name, add columns and relations and create it. This is a basic designer and more advanced features to customise every aspect of the entity will be added later. Column specifications Link Columns of the entity can be customized: Property Name Property Type Description Name string human readable name, can be skipped ColumnName string column name in the table ColumnDescription string human readable description ColumnType string column type is a rich type of the column IsIndexed boolean true to add an index on this column IsUnique boolean true to set a unique constraint on this column IsNullable boolean are null values allowed Permission uint64 permission column (check authorization docs) DataType string the column type inside the database DefaultValue string default value if any (has to be inside single quotes for static values Options Array[value,label] Valid values if column in enum type Column types Link Daptin supports a variety of rich data types, which helps it to automatically make intelligent decisions and validations. Here is a list of all column types and what should they be used for Type Name Description Example id an identity column, mostly for internal purposes 1 alias a foreign key column uuid v4 date full date, no time 2017-12-30 time time/time interval, no date 12:34:54 day day of the month 1 to 31 month month of the year 1 to 12 year Year 2017 minute minute of the hour 0 to 59 hour hour of the dat 0 - 23 datetime date + time (not stored as timestamp, served at date time string) 2017-12-30T12:34:54 email email test@domain.com name column to be used as name of the entity daptin json JSON data {} password password - are bcrypted with cost 11 $2a$11$z/VlxycDgZ... value value is enumeration type completed truefalse boolean 1 timestamp timestamp (stored as timestamp, served as timestamp) 123123123 location.latitude only latitude 34.2938 location latitude + longitude in geoJson format [34.223,64.123] location.longitude only longitude 64.123 location.altitude only altitude 34 color hex color string #ABCDE1 rating.10 rating on a scale of 10 8 measurement numeric column 534 label a label for the entity, similar to name but can be more than one red content larger contents - texts/html/json/yaml very long text file uploads, connect storage for using this url Urls/links http://docs.dapt.in Data relations Link A data oriented system with no relational knowledge of the data is next to an Excel sheet. Specifying relations in your data is the most important thing after creating your entities. Relations are constraints among tables and help you keep clean and consistent data. Relational data is easily accessible over APIs using a path structure like /api/<entityName>/<id>/<relationName> and the response is consistent with JSONAPI.org . Checkout the relation apis exposed by daptin. !!! example\"YAML example\" Relations : - Subject : todo Relation : has_one Object : project !!! example\"JSON example\" { \"Relations\" : [ { \"Subject\" : \"todo\" , \"Relation\" : \"has_one\" , \"Object\" : \"project\" } ] } Relations in JSON/YAML schema Link When uploading schema using a JSON / YAML file, relations can be added in the same file and daptin will create appropriate constraints and foreign keys in your underlying database. Continuing with our example of todos, lets say we want to group todo's in \"projects\" and each todo can belong to only a single project. Lets design a \"project\" entity: - TableName : project Columns : - Name : name DataType : varchar(200) ColumnType : name IsIndexed : true A very simple table with just a name column. Now we can tell daptin about the relation between todos and projects Relations : - Subject : todo Relation : has_one Object : project This tells daptin that todo \"has_one\" project. Relations types Link Any entity can be associated to any other entity (or to itself) as one of the follows Relation Name Relation Descriptio Can be empty belongs_to a single object relation No has_one a single object relation Yes has_many many related objects Yes Default relations Link Every entity created on daptin has at least two relations Relation Type Related Entity Purpose belongs user owner of the object has many usergroup belongs to usergroup These relations help you precisely control the authorization for each user. Read more about authorization and permissions Multiple relation Link There can be a scenario where two entities are related in more then 1 way. Consider the following example A blog entity A post entity Blog has many posts Each blog can have a \"highlighted post\" (blog has one \"highlighted post\") To achieve the above scenario, our schema would look like as follows Tables : - TableName : blog Columns : - Name : title DataType : varchar(500) ColumnType : label - Name : view_count DataType : int(11) ColumnType : measurement - TableName : post Columns : - Name : title DataType : varchar(200) ColumnType : label - Name : body DataType : text ColumnType : content - TableName : comment Columns : - Name : body DataType : text ColumnType : content - Name : likes_count ColumnName : likes_count DataType : int(11) ColumnType : measurement Relations : - Subject : comment Relation : belongs_to Object : post - Subject : post Relation : belongs_to Object : blog // this is our post belongs to blog relation - Subject : blog Relation : has_one Object : post ObjectName : current_post SubjectName : current_post_of // this is our highlighted post relation Notice the \"SubjectName\" and \"ObjectName\" keys which helps to name our relations more intuitively. SQL constraints Link belongs to Link A column is added to the subject entity, which refers to the Object entity, set to non nullable has one Link Same as above, but nullable has many Link A join table is created Importing data Link Upload one of these files: File Usage Schema JSON Create schema and apis CSV Auto create entity and upload data XLSX Auto create entity and upload data Data JSON Upload data from dumps Excel file upload Link Excel upload provides an easy way to create entities. This takes away the complexity of writing each column type. Daptin uses a combination of rules to identify columns and their types based on the data in the excel. You can upload data from XLS. Daptin will take care of going through your XLS file and identifying column types. This is one of the easiest and fastest ways to create entities and uploading data in daptin. You can specify relations among entities later from the online designer. CSV file upload Link CSV upload provides an easy way to create entities. This takes away the complexity of writing each column type. Daptin uses a combination of rules to identify columns and their types based on the data in the csv. You can upload data from CSV. Daptin will take care of going through your XLS file and identifying column types. This is one of the easiest and fastest ways to create entities and uploading data in daptin. You can specify relations among entities later from the online designer. Data conformations Link Daptin uses the excellent leebenson/conform library to apply conformations on data before storing them in the database Conform: keep user input in check (go, golang) Trim, sanitize, and modify struct string fields in place, based on tags. Use it for names, e-mail addresses, URL slugs, or any other form field where formatting matters. Conform doesn't attempt any kind of validation on your fields. Data auditing Link To enable recoding of all historical data for a particular entity, enable data audit for it in the worlds configuration. Audits are ready only and cannot be manipulated over api. You can configure the permission for your use case. All changes in daptin can be recorded by enabling auditing . History is maintained in separate audit tables which maintain a copy of all columns at each change. Audit table are entities just like regular entities. All Patch/Put/Delete calls to daptin will create an entry in the audit table if the entity is changed. Audit tables Link For any entity named <X> , another tables <X>_audit is added by daptin. Eg if you enable auditing of the user_account table, then a user_account_audit table will be created. The audit table will contain all the columns which are present in the original table, plus an extra column is_audit_of is added, which contains the ID of the original row. The is_audit_of is a foreign key column to the parent tables id column. Audit row Link Each row in the audit table is the copy of the original row just before it is being modified. The audit rows can be accessed just like any other relation. Audit table permissions Link By default, everyone has the access to create audit row, and no one has the access to update or delete them. These permissions can be changed, but it is not recommended at present.

Here is an example of a stream which exposes list of completed todos only { StreamName: \"transformed_user\", RootEntityName: \"todo\", Columns: []api2go.ColumnInfo{ // List of columns in this stream { Name: \"transformed_todo_title\", ColumnType: \"label\", }, { Name: \"completed_on\", ColumnType: \"datetime\", }, }, QueryParams: QueryParams{ \"Filter\": \"completed=true\", \"Select\": \"title,deadline\", }, Transformations: []Transformation{ { Operation: \"select\", Attributes: map[string]interface{}{ \"columns\": []string{\"title\", \"deadline\"}, }, }, { Operation: \"rename\", Attributes: map[string]interface{}{ \"oldName\": \"title\", \"newName\": \"transformed_todo_title\", }, }, { Operation: \"rename\", Attributes: map[string]interface{}{ \"oldName\": \"deadline\", \"newName\": \"completed_on\", }, }, }, } Daptin uses the library kniren/gota to systematically specific list of transformations which are applied to the original data stream.","title":"Data streams"},{"location":"streams/streams/#streams","text":"Streams are complimentary to actions .

Password field has a column_type password which makes daptin to bcrypt it before storing, and password fields are never returned in any JSONAPI call. Authentication Link Authentication involves identifying the current user of the request. Daptin expectes a JWT token issued at signin as Authorization: Bearer <Token> header, otherwise the request is considered coming from a guest . Signup API Link Sign up action can be allowed to guests for open registration by anyone. Users with enough permission over the user_account table can create users manually. Users registered using signup action are their own owners. Hence they can update and delete themselves. These permission can be changed based on the use case. !!! example\"POST call for user registration\" curl 'http://localhost:6336/action/user_account/signup' \\ -H 'Authorization: Bearer null' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8' \\ -H 'Accept: application/json, text/plain, */*' \\ --data-binary '{\"attributes\":{\"name\":\"username\",\"email\":\"<UserEmail>\",\"password\":\"<Password>\",\"passwordConfirm\":\"<Password>\"}}' You can either allow guests to be able to invoke sign up action or allow only a particular user to be able to create new users or a usergroup. [ { \"ResponseType\" : \"client.notify\" , \"Attributes\" : { \"message\" : \"Created user\" , \"title\" : \"Success\" , \"type\" : \"success\" } } ] This user can sign in now (generate an auth token). But what he can access is again based on the permission of the system. Directly into user_account table Link import requests headers = { 'Authorization': 'Bearer <Auth Token>', } data = '{ \"data\": { \"type\": \"user\", \"attributes\": { \"email\": \"test@user.com\", \"name\": \"test\", \"password\": \"password\", } } }' response = requests.post('http://localhost:6336/api/user', headers=headers, data=data) You can manually add users from the users page, or allow sign-up action to be performed by guests which will take care of creating a user and an associated usergroup for that user. All new signed up users will also be added to the \"users\" usergroup. Guests Link Requests without a valid Authorization Bearer token will be referred to as \"guests requests\". Requests with a valid token will have an identified user in the context. Authorization Link Daptin has a built-in authorization framework based on users groups and permissions. Users are identified by their authorization token or other means of identification. Each request is identified as coming from a registered user or a guest. Permission model Link Every read/write to the system passes through two level of permission check. Type level: apply permission on all types of entities at the same time Data level: object level permission The world table contains two columns: Permission : defines the entity level permission Default permission : defines the default permission for a new object of this entity type The default permission for an object is picked from the default permission setting, and can be changed after the object creation (if the permission allows). Peek Link Peek gives access to the user to read data in the system but not allow it in response as data. So while the query to read the data will execute and certain actions can be allowed over them, directly trying to read the data in response will fail. [C] Create Link Create allows a new row to be created by using the POST api. Note: this doesn't apply over indirect creations using actions *. [R] Read Link Read allows the data to be served in the http response body. The response will usually follow the JSONAPI.org structure. [U] Update Link Update allows the data fields to be updated using the PUT/PATCH http methods. [D] Delete Link Delete gives permission to be delete a row or certain type of data using DELETE http method. Unless you have enabled auditing , you will permanently loose this data. [R] Refer Link Refer gives permission to add data/users to usergroups. Note that you will also need certain permission on the usergroup as well. [X] Execute Link Execute gives permission to invoke action over data (like export). Note that giving access to a type of data doesn't give access to all rows of that entity type . Authorization Link Authorization is the part where daptin decides if the caller has enough permission to execute the call. Access check happens at two levels: Entity level check Object level check Both the checks have a \"before\" and \"after\" part. Object level permission check Link Once the call clears the entity level check, an object level permission check is applied. This happens in cases where the action is going to affect/read an existing row. The permission is stored in the same way. Each table has a permission column which stores the permission in OOOGGGXXX format. Order of permission check Link The permission is checked in order of: Check if the user is owner, if yes, check if permission allows the current action, if yes do action Check if the user belongs to a group to which this object also belongs, if yes, check if permisison allows the current action, if yes do action User is guest, check if guest permission allows this actions, if yes do action, if no, unauthorized Things to note here: There is no negative permission (this may be introduced in the future) eg, you cannot say owner is 'not allowed' to read but read by guest is allowed. Permission check is done in a hierarchy type order Access flow Link Every \"interaction\" in daptin goes through two levels of access. Each level has a before and after check. Entity level access: does the user invoking the interaction has the appropriate permission to invoke this (So for sign up, the user table need to be writable by guests, for sign in the user table needs to be peakable by guests) Instance level access: this is the second level, even if a User Account has access to \"user\" entity, not all \"user\" rows would be accessible by them So the actual checks happen in following order: \"Before check\" for entity \"Before check\" for instance \"After check\" for instance \"After check\" for entity Each of these checks can filter out objects where the user does not have enough permission. Entity level permission Link Entity level permission are set in the world table and can be updated from dashboard. This can be done by updating the \"permission\" column for the entity. For these changes to take effect a restart is necessary. Instance level permission Link Like we saw in the entity documentation , every table has a permission column. No restart is necessary for changes in these permission. You can choose to disable new user registration by changing the signup action permissions. User data API Examples Link Users are just like any other data you maintain. User information is stored in the user_account table and exposed over /api/user_account endpoint. You can choose to allow read/write permission directly to that table to allow other users/processes to use this api to read/create/update/delete users. User groups Link User groups is a group concept that helps you manage \"who\" can interact with daptin, and in what ways. All objects (including users and groups) belong to one or more user group. Users can interact with objects which also belong to their group based on the defined group permission setting Social login Link Oauth connection can be used to allow guests to identify themselves based on the email provided by the oauth id provider. Social login Link Allow users to login using their existing social accounts like twitter/google/github. Daptin can work with any oauth flow aware identity provider to allow new users to be registered (if you have disabled normal signup). Create a OAuth Connection and mark \"Allow login\" to enable APIs for OAuth flow. Examples !!! example\"Google login configuration\" !!! example\"Dropbox login configuration\" !!! example\"Github login configuration\" !!! example\"Linkedin login configuration\" !!! example\"Encrypted values\" The secrets are stored after encryption so the value you see in above screenshots are encrypted values. Configuring default user group Link You can configure which User groups should newly registered users be added to after their signup. This can be configured in the table properties from the dashboard or by updating the entity configuration from the API Restart required Restart is required for default group settings to take effect Authentication token Link The authentication token is a JWT token issued by daptin on sign in action. Users can create new actions to allow other means of generating JWT token. It is as simple as adding another outcome to an action. Server side Link Daptin uses OAuth 2 based authentication strategy. HTTP calls are checked for Authorization header, and if present, validated as a JWT token. The JWT token should have been issued by daptin earlier and should not have expired. To see how to generate JWT token, checkout the sing-in action . The JWT token contains the issuer information (daptin) plus basic user profile (email). The JWT token has a one hour (configurable) expiry from the time of issue. If the token is absent or invalid, the user is considered as a guest. Guests also have certain permissions. Checkout the Authorization docs for details. Client side Link On the client side, for dashboard, the token is stored in local storage. The local storage is cleared on logout or if the server responds with a 401 Unauthorized status.","title":"User management"},{"location":"user-management/access/#user-management","text":"Daptin maintains its own User accounts and User groups entries in the database.
