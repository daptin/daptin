# An agent defines the environment in which your code runs.
# It is a combination of one of available machine types and operating
# system images.

# Blocks are the heart of a pipeline and are executed sequentially.
# Each block has a task that defines one or more jobs. Jobs define the
# commands to execute.
# See https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/62-concepts
blocks:
- name: Build project
  task:
    jobs:
    - name: go get & build
      commands:
      # Download code from Git repository. This step is mandatory if the
      # job is to work with your code.
      - checkout
      # Set version of Go:
      - sem-version go 1.12
      - go get github.com/GeertJohan/go.rice/rice
      # Download dependencies and build the project:
      - go get -d -v ./...
      - go get github.com/lib/pq
      - go build webServer.go
      - rice embed-go
      - go build -v -o main
      # Store the binary in cache to reuse in further blocks.
      # More about caching: https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/54-toolbox-reference#cache
      - mkdir -p docker_dir
