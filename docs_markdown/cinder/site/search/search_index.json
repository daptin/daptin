            "text": "Cinder Theme \nfor MkDocs\n\n\n\nAbout\n\n\nCinder is a clean, responsive theme for static documentation sites that are generated with \nMkDocs\n. It's built on the \nBootstrap framework\n and includes pre-packaged syntax highlighting (\nhighlight.js\n), icons (\n \nFontAwesome\n), and a smashingly legible type scheme to get your message out to your users.\n\n\nYou are looking at the theme and can see a selection of the theme elements on the \nSpecimen page\n.\n\n\nInstall\n\n\nRequired\n: Python 2.6+ or 3.3+\n\n\nInstall MkDocs \n Create a New Project\n\n\nIf you haven't installed MkDocs yet, use the following command to install it:\n\n\n$ pip install mkdocs\n\n\n\nNext, navigate to a clean directory and create a new MkDocs project with the following command:\n\n\n$ mkdocs new [projectname]\n\n\n\nReplace \n[projectname]\n with the name of your project (without the brackets).\n\n\nThen navigate to the root of your project directory:\n\n\n$ cd [projectname]\n\n\n\nInstall the Cinder Theme\n\n\nChoose one of the following install approaches:\n\n\n1. Install with pip\n\n\nIf you are using MkDocs v0.15.0 or higher, you can install the Cinder theme with pip using the command:\n\n\n$ pip install mkdocs-cinder\n\n\n\nMkDocs projects use a YAML settings file called \nmkdocs.yml\n.  This is located in the root of your project directory after you use the \nmkdocs new\n command.  Open the file in a text editor and modify it to define Cinder in the \ntheme\n setting as follows (note that this is case-sensitive):\n\n\nsite_name: [YOURPROJECT]\ntheme: cinder\npages:\n- Home: index.md\n\n\n\n\nTheme Updates\n: If you choose the pip install approach, you can update your Cinder theme to new releases with the command \n$ pip install --upgrade mkdocs-cinder\n.  Then re-build your static site files (see instructions below).\n\n\n2. Manual Install\n\n\nDownload the Cinder theme archive.\n\n\n  Download Cinder v0.10.0\n\n\nUnpack the contents of the archive into a directory named \ncinder\n at the top level of your MkDocs project directory.\n\n\nYour project directory should now look like this:\n\n\n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 mkdocs.yml\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 cinder\n\u2502     \u251c\u2500\u2500 css\n\u2502     \u251c\u2500\u2500 img\n\u2502     \u251c\u2500\u2500 js\n\u2502     \u251c\u2500\u2500 base.html\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0   \u251c\u2500\u2500 content.html\n\u2502     \u251c\u2500\u2500 404.html\n\u2502     \u251c\u2500\u2500 nav-sub.html\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0   \u251c\u2500\u2500 nav.html\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0   \u2514\u2500\u2500 toc.html\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 docs\n      \u2514\u2500\u2500 index.md\n\n\n\n\nMkDocs projects use a YAML settings file called \nmkdocs.yml\n.  This is located in the root of your project directory after you use the \nmkdocs new\n command.  Open the file in a text editor and modify it to include the \ntheme_dir\n setting as follows:\n\n\nsite_name: [YOURPROJECT]\ntheme_dir: cinder\npages:\n- Home: index.md\n\n\n\n\nTheme Updates\n: If you choose the manual install approach, you can update your Cinder theme by downloading the new cinder.zip release archive and including it in your project. Then re-build your static site files (see instructions below).\n\n\nTest with a Local Site Server\n\n\nUse the following command to establish a local server for your site:\n\n\n$ mkdocs serve\n\n\n\nThen open your site in any browser at the URL \nhttp://localhost:8000\n.\n\n\nCreate Your Site\n\n\nAdd Content with Markdown Syntax\n\n\nGet to work on your site home page by opening the \ndocs/index.md\n file and editing it in Markdown syntax.  The HTML automatically updates in the browser when you save the Markdown file if you use the MkDocs server (see command above).\n\n\nAdd New Pages\n\n\nAdd new pages to your site by creating a new Markdown file in your \ndocs\n directory, then linking to the new page in the \nmkdocs.yml\n file.  This uses a \nPage Name : Markdown file\n syntax.\n\n\nFor example, to add an About page using a Markdown file that is located on the path \ndocs/about.md\n, you would format the \nmkdocs.yml\n file as follows:\n\n\nsite_name: [YOURPROJECT]\ntheme_dir: cinder\npages:\n- Home: index.md\n- About: about.md\n\n\n\nAdd additional pages to your site by repeating the above series of steps.\n\n\nBuild Your Site\n\n\nBuild your site files with the command:\n\n\n$ mkdocs build\n\n\n\nYour site files are built in the \nsite\n directory and are ready to use.  Deploy the contents of the \nsite\n directory to your web server.\n\n\nSite Customization\n\n\nThe following are a few common customizations that you might be interested in.  For much more detail about the configuration of your site, check out the \nMkDocs Configuration documentation\n.\n\n\nSite Favicon\n\n\nPlace your site favicon image file in the top level of your docs directory and then include a new \nsite_favicon:\n field in the \nmkdocs.yml\n file:\n\n\nsite_name: [YOURPROJECT]\ntheme_dir: cinder\nsite_favicon: favicon.ico\npages:\n  - Home: index.md\n  - About: about.md\n\n\n\nAdd Your Own CSS Stylesheets\n\n\nCreate a \ncss\n directory inside your \ndocs\n directory and add your CSS files.  You can overwrite any of the Cinder styles in your CSS files.  Then include your CSS files in the \nmkdocs.yml\n file with the \nextra_css\n field:\n\n\nsite_name: [YOURPROJECT]\ntheme_dir: cinder\nextra_css:\n  - \"css/mystyle.css\"\n  - \"css/myotherstyle.css\"\npages:\n  - Home: index.md\n  - About: about.md\n\n\n\nYour CSS styles fall at the end of the cascade and will override all styles included in the theme (including Bootstrap and default Cinder styles).  You can find the Cinder and Bootstrap CSS files on the paths \ncinder/css/cinder.css\n and \ncinder/css/bootstrap.min.css\n, respectively.\n\n\nAdd Your Own JavaScript\n\n\nCreate a \njs\n directory inside your \ndocs\n directory and add your JS files.  Then include your JS files in the \nmkdocs.yml\n file with the \nextra_js\n field:\n\n\nsite_name: [YOURPROJECT]\ntheme_dir: cinder\nextra_js:\n  - \"js/myscript.js\"\n  - \"js/myotherscript.js\"\npages:\n  - Home: index.md\n  - About: about.md\n\n\n\nGithub or Bitbucket Repository Link\n\n\nInclude the \nrepo_url\n field and define it with your repository URL:\n\n\nsite_name: [YOURPROJECT]\ntheme_dir: cinder\nrepo_url: \"https://github.com/chrissimpkins/cinder\"\npages:\n  - Home: index.md\n  - About: about.md\n\n\n\nThe link appears at the upper right hand corner of your site.\n\n\nLicense Declaration and Link\n\n\nThe Cinder theme displays your license declaration in the footer if you include a \ncopyright\n field and define it with the text (and optionally the HTML link) that you would like to display:\n\n\nsite_name: [YOURPROJECT]\ntheme_dir: cinder\ncopyright: \"Cinder is licensed under the \na href='https://github.com/chrissimpkins/cinder/blob/master/LICENSE.md'\nMIT license\n\"\npages:\n  - Home: index.md\n  - About: about.md\n\n\n\nIssues\n\n\nIf you have any issues with the theme, please report them on the Cinder repository:\n\n\nReport Issue\n\n\nActive Issues\n\n\nLicense\n\n\nCinder is licensed under the MIT license.
