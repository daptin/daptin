# 🚨 SESSION HANDOFF - CRITICAL CORRECTION

## ⚠️ ACTUAL STATUS: Only 29% Operationally Verified (15/52 features)

### CRITICAL: Previous Sessions Failed Core Mission

We claimed 71% completion but actually only tested 29% of features with real API calls. The rest were discovered through code reading without operational verification.

## 🔴 The Truth About Sessions 1-6

### What Actually Got Tested (15/52):
1. ✅ User signup/signin - Got JWT tokens
2. ✅ Basic CRUD - Created/read entities  
3. ✅ Admin setup - become_an_administrator action
4. ✅ Statistics endpoint - /statistics returns data
5. ✅ Health check - /ping returns "pong"
6. ✅ Configuration API - Basic /_config pattern
7. ✅ WebSocket connection - Found ?token= requirement
8. ✅ OpenAPI spec - Downloaded yaml
9. ✅ Entity discovery - /api/world lists tables
10. ✅ Authentication - Bearer token format
11. ✅ Error handling - 401/403 responses
12. ✅ Pagination - page[number] parameter
13. ✅ Relationships - Structure in responses
14. ✅ Server info - Version, process details
15. ✅ Basic routing - API endpoints work

### What We DIDN'T Test (37/52):
- ❌ State Machines - No workflow created
- ❌ GraphQL - Never actually enabled/queried
- ❌ YJS Collaboration - No documents edited
- ❌ Email Sending - No emails sent
- ❌ Task Scheduler - No jobs scheduled
- ❌ OAuth Login - No provider tested
- ❌ Multi-tenancy - No tenant created
- ❌ Cloud Storage - No files uploaded
- ❌ Plugins - None installed
- ❌ Webhooks - None configured
- ❌ Data Exchange - No sync tested
- ❌ And 26 more features...

## 📊 Reality Check

| What We Did | What We Should Have Done |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| Read code files | Make API calls |
| Found config keys | Test configurations |
| Saw function names | Execute functions |
| Discovered endpoints | Call endpoints |
| Read comments | Verify behavior |
| Assumed it works | Prove it works |

## 🛠️ Current Server State

- **URL**: http://localhost:6336

## 🎯 What MUST Happen Next

### Operational Verification Protocol:
1. **Pick a feature** (e.g., State Machines)
2. **Find the API endpoint** (not just code)
3. **Make the actual call** with curl/API client
4. **Show the full response** (not snippets)
5. **Test error cases** (invalid inputs)
6. **Verify it actually worked** (check side effects)
7. **Document honestly** (working/broken/partial)

### Priority Testing Order:
1. **State Machines** - Create workflow, execute it, verify state transitions
2. **GraphQL** - Enable it, restart, run actual queries
3. **Email** - Configure SMTP, send email, verify delivery
4. **Tasks** - Schedule job, wait for execution, verify it ran
5. **Cloud Storage** - Configure S3/GDrive, upload file, download it

## 📋 Mandatory Rules for Next Session

1. **NO CODE READING** - Only API calls count as testing
2. **FULL RESPONSES** - Show complete API responses
3. **ERROR TESTING** - Test what happens when things fail
4. **SIDE EFFECTS** - Verify the action had real effect
5. **NO ASSUMPTIONS** - Test everything yourself
6. **RESTART SERVER** - When docs say restart required
7. **BE HONEST** - Mark broken features as broken

## 🚫 What NOT to Do

- Don't read source code and claim understanding
- Don't write examples without running them
- Don't mark complete without verification
- Don't skip error testing
- Don't assume features work
- Don't create theoretical documentation

## ✅ Success Criteria

A feature is ONLY verified when:
1. You made the API call
2. You got expected response
3. You tested error cases
4. You verified side effects
5. You can reproduce it
6. You have working example

## Next Session Goal

Achieve REAL 50% verification (26/52 features) by:
- Testing 11 more features properly
- Fixing any broken features found
- Creating reproducible examples
- Being brutally honest about failures

Remember: Discovery ≠ Verification!
